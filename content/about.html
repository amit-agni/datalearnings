<h3>Me</h3>
<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Amit Agni. I am a data specialist at Virgin Australia. My day job involves analysing airline data to create data-driven products for sales, e-commerce and finance departments. I have been in the tech industry for over 20 years and worked across India, UAE, USA and Australia.</p>
<p>Since 2016, I have focused my career on data analytics and data science. I mostly use R for my work and intend to use Python in the near future.</p>
<p>I am an eternal learner so love to update myself with latest happenings in the data world.</p>
