<p>Hi, I am Amit Agni, a worshiper of data üòä</p>
<p>My day job is at Virgin Australia, Brisbane as a Data Specialist. I analyse ‚úàÔ∏è data to create products for sales, e-commerce and finance departments.</p>
<p>I have been in the tech industry for over 20 years and worked across India, Dubai and USA. My professional career has seen me teaching programming, assembling PCs, installing networks, managing data-center servers and designing information systems. Now, I apply mathematical and statistical methods to pull out patterns and meaning from data.</p>
<p>A firm believer of the new data religion that says <code>&quot;Listen to the algorithms! They know how you feel&quot;</code>, my passion is building data-driven products that can extract knowledge and derive actionable insights.</p>

<h3>Data Learnings</h3>
<p>This is my personal blog in which I write about everything in the data domain. In the blog, you will find</p>
<ul>
<li>the notes that I have taken while studying online courses and while reading books (some are not data related)</li>
<li>the exploratory analysis and predictive models created as part of data competitions like Kaggle, Analytics Vidhya, etc</li>
<li>documentation of personal data mining projects</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope it helps you in your own data journey. If you‚Äôd like to connect/collaborate with me, you can add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitagni/%22">Linkedin</a> or <a href="mailto:amitagni2@gmail.com">email me</a>.
