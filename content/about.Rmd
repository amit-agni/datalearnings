### Me ###

Hi, I'm Amit Agni. I am a data specialist at Virgin Australia. My day job involves extracting/analysing airline data to create data-driven products for sales, e-commerce and finance departments. I have been in the tech industry for over 20 years and worked across India, UAE, USA and Australia. 

Since 2016, I have focused my career on data analytics and data science. I mostly use R for my work and intend to use Python in the near future.

I am an eternal learner so love to update myself with latest happenings in the data world.

### Data Learnings ###

This is my personal blog in which I write about everything in the data domain. In the blog, you will find  

* the notes that I have taken while studying online courses and while reading books
* the exploratory analysis and predictive models created as part of data competitions like Kaggle
* documentation of my personal projects 

I hope the blog helps you in your own data journey. If you'd like to connect/collaborate with me, you can add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitagni/") or [email me](mailto:amitagni2@gmail.com). I host my projects and repositories on [github](https://github.com/amit-agni/)
